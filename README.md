# Cherysh: A UNIX Shell with a Stack VM and Meta-programming


So, I am currently working on 3 languages. This is one of them. The other one is [Squawk](https://github.com/Chubek/Squawk) which is pretty fall along, and the other one is [JigCC](https://github.com/Chubek/JigCC) --- a C compiler written in Java with my own IR. JigCC is still at infancy. This project, Cherysh, is not as well-progressed as Squawk is, but there's still a good amount of functions defined inside `exec-loop.c`. I have already added the quoting system. I have added the exec-fork-wait loop as well. I have added file dupping as well. So a lot of 'basic' Shell stuff are already defined.



# Updates

## A lot of funcions and variables, including the main exec function in `exec-loop.c`. Done!

## I just created the global variables for `parallel-exec.c`.


Thanks to `u/NextYam3704` who suggested me to share the repository, otherwise I would not have remoted it!
